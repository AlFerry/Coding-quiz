# Coding-quiz
A quiz about coding, challenge your friends!

User story:
As a user I want to test my knowledge of coding by taking a timed quiz that will give me a score and let me keep track of high scores.

-This program uses javascript to display questions and possible answers in a quiz format then checks to see if the correct answer was chosen. 
-If the correct answer is chosen, five points are added to the user's score and they continue to the next question. 
-If the incorrect answer is chosen, three seconds are deducted from the remaining time and the user tries to select the correct answer again. 
-Once either the time has runout or the user has answered all of the questions, they are prompted to input their initials which are then stored with their score into local storage.
-At this point the user is taken to the list of the top 10 high scores, but they may access this at any point by clicking the "See high scores" button.
